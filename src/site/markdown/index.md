# AGT Clustering Challenge

Companion package for the clustering challenge in AGT 2017-18.

## Challenge

Given a graph in *Bipartite format*, develop a clustering algorithm to partition
its *hubs* into groups of closely related vertices. Your output should comply
with the *Partition format*.

## Contents

In this document you will find the specification of the *Bipartite format* and
the *Partition format* as well usage documentation for the tools included in the
package to help you develop and test your solution.
