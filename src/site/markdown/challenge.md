# Challenge

Given a graph in *Bipartite format*, develop a clustering algorithm to partition
its *hubs* into groups of closely related vertices. Your output should comply
with the *Partition format*.

In this document you will find the specification of the *Bipartite format* and
the *Partition format* as well as some tools to help you develop and test your
solution.
